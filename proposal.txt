Rationale
In the traditional classroom setting, language learners are typically exposed to only one native speaker: their teacher. This study investigates the impact of hearing multiple native speakers produce vocabulary to determine if one-vs-many speakers impacts their vocabulary acquisition. 

Hypothesis
L2 Spanish learners exposed to multiple people speaking will acquire vocabulary more accurately than those exposed to only one person. This will be a function of proficiency, will low-proficiency speakers will see less of an effect from exposure to multiple people, and high-proficiency speakers will see more of an effect.

H1:	L2 Spanish learners will acquire more vocabulary when exposed to multiple people.
	H0: 	L2 Spanish learners will acquire the same amount of vocabulary when exposed to multiple people as opposed to one person.
H2:	The acquisition will be more pronounced in high proficiency learners.
	H0:	the acquisition will be the same for high and low proficiency learners.

Materials & Methods
L1 Spanish speakers will record 30 words. 
L1 and L2 Spanish speakers will complete a survey for biographical data (information collected below).
L2 Spanish learners will be exposed to 30 words aurally with English translations appearing on screen. They will hear each item three times. Afterwards, they will see the English words and must record themselves saying the corresponding Spanish translation.

The 15 words will be taken from the Cervantes Institute (https://cvc.cervantes.es/ensenanza/biblioteca_ele/plan_curricular/indice.htm). Words are recorded in materials>vocabulary.

Information from L1 Spanish speakers:
>country of origin
>city of origin
>age
>gender

Information from L2 Spanish speakers:
>age
>gender
>Spanish proficiency (DELE and LexTale)
>experience with the dialect of L1 speakers

Data analysis:

H1
We expect there to be a relationship between item accuracy and exposure to one or multiple people. We expect that the group exposed to multiple people will have higher accuracy.
Model:
Mixed effects general linear model:
	glmer(
		formula = accuracy ~ many_persons + one_person + (1 + item|participant)
		data = df
		family = 'identity')
	)
	Fixed effects = many_vs_one (categorical)
	Random effects = participant, item

H2
We expect there to be an interaction between proficiency and exposure to one or multiple dialects. We expect that higher proficiency L2 Spanish learners will have a more pronounced accuracy when exposed to multiple dialects than their low proficiency counterparts.
Model:
Mixed effects logistic model:
	glmer(
		forumla = accuracy ~ profiency + many_vs_one + proficiency*many_vs_one
		data = df
		family = 'binomial'
	)
	Fixed effects:	Spanish proficiency (continuous), many_vs_one (categorical), accuracy (categorical)
	Random effects:	participant, item
	Interactions: proficiency*many_vs_one

Future Research
>One vs Many dialects
>Exposure to L2 speakers (low proficiency vs high proficiency)
